Description: Time-based joins to analyze sequence of events, 
    both in memory and out of memory. after_join() joins two 
    tables of events, while funnel_start() and funnel_step() 
    join events in the same table. With the type argument, you
    can switch between different funnel types, like first-first
    and last-firstafter.
